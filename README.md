# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Version
- Ruby 2.7.2
- Rails 5.2.6

* System dependencies
### Ruby 2.7.2
- Check your Ruby version `ruby -v`
- If your version is NOT Ruby 2.7.2, you can install Ruby 2.7.2 with `rbenv install 2.7.2`
- To set the Ruby version for a directory and all subdirectories within it, `cd <repo name>` then run `rbenv local 2.7.2`
- Double check that your Ruby version is correct after changing it with `ruby -v`

### Rails 5.2.6
- [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html) is a Gem, and if you are using rbenv, gems are specific to your current Ruby version, so you need to make sure you are on Ruby 2.7.2 before proceeding by following the instructions above.
- Check your Rails version `rails -v`
- If you get a message saying rails is not installed or you do not have version 5.2.5, run `gem install rails --version 5.2.5`.
- Double check that your Ruby version is correct after changing it with `rails -v`
